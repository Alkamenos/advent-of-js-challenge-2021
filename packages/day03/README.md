# Brief

![img.png](img.png)

In this project, we're creating a keyboard. I love this project because at first glance it seems easy, but there are some more complicated steps involved.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

-   See the keyboard centered on the page
-   Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors
    -   White keys will change to yellow `#ffd200`
    -   Black keys will change to pink `#f40082`
-   When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip.
    -   The audio clips are numbered, but they don't have to

# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project / file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

-   Use a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
-   Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the Advent of CSS solutions, where Amy explains exactly how to build this.
-   When the timer is completed, play the alert sound. (Audio file included)
