# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a computer keyboard.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

-   See the computer keyboard centered on the page
-   A random letter will start to jiggle.
-   The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
-   A new, random key will start jiggling

# Getting Started

1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project / file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**

# Taking your Project to the Next Level

-   Use a framework like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous, try writing everything in Vanilla JavaScript.
-   Take a step back and try writing the HTML and CSS for this project yourself. Start with the provided Figma file. If you get stuck, consider purchasing the Advent of CSS solutions, where Amy explains exactly how to build this.
-   Keep track of how many keys are successfully typed correctly, the first time.
-   Keep track of how many keys are missed
-   Time the user to see how many successful key presses they can get within a given amount of time.
